        <h3>"Literature built to last."</h3>
        <p>
          Wexley & Thorne Press is an independent publishing house focused on thoughtful, enduring literature.
          We work closely with authors to publish books that are sharp, resonant, and carefully made â€” stories that hold up over time and invite return.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our catalog spans fiction, nonfiction, and hybrid work, with an emphasis on strong voice and clear intent.
          We believe in good editing, good design, and the long arc of a well-told story.
